# UJAAGAR: AI-Driven Disaster Prediction & Quick Relief System

## About the Project
UJAAGAR is an AI-powered system designed to predict disasters, forecast aid requirements, and streamline relief efforts in real time. Our goal is to enhance disaster response efficiency by leveraging AI-driven automation, smart resource allocation, and volunteer coordination.

## Problem Statement
Aid during disasters is often delayed due to poor coordination between volunteers, resources, and those in need. Existing solutions are either fragmented or require manual intervention, leading to inefficiencies in disaster response.

## Proposed Solution
- AI-based disaster prediction using a **Random Forest Classification model**
- Real-time **resource forecasting** to prevent over/under-supply
- **Multilingual chatbot** for emergency help requests
- **AI-driven volunteer and resource matching**
- **Smart route optimization** for faster aid delivery
- **Live dashboard** for real-time monitoring

## Features
- **Rapid Emergency Response** – AI-powered disaster predictions and instant resource allocation
- **Accurate Aid Forecasting** – Prevents shortages and surplus relief supply
- **Unified Relief Coordination** – Connects government agencies, NGOs, and volunteers
- **AI-Optimized Routing** – Ensures aid reaches affected areas efficiently
- **Victim-Centric Chatbot** – Allows disaster victims to request help and share their location
- **Transparent & Trusted Relief** – Trust scoring system prevents fraud
- **Scalable & Adaptable** – Works across multiple disaster types and locations

## Technical Approach
- **Disaster Prediction**: AI-driven approach utilizing historical disaster data
- **Data Processing**: Cleaning, missing value handling, and feature scaling (Z-score, MinMax scaling)
- **Smart Matching Algorithm**: Dynamically assigns volunteers and resources
- **Chatbot**: Provides real-time support and assistance
- **Visualization Dashboard**: Built with Google Maps API for real-time monitoring
- **Backend**: Developed using Flask for scalable and efficient data processing

## Roadmap
### Year 1
- Pilot launch with government and NGOs
- Deploy core system (disaster prediction, volunteer-resource matching, real-time dashboard)
- Establish a trusted volunteer network

### Year 2
- Expand to more states
- Integrate with official disaster management systems
- Incorporate satellite & weather data for better forecasting

### Year 3
- Upgrade AI models to predict disaster timing
- Optimize real-time coordination algorithms for faster response

### Year 4
- Launch mobile app & multilingual chatbot
- Automate volunteer onboarding

### Year 5
- Achieve nationwide adoption
- Collaborate with international NGOs for global reach

## Commercialization Approach
- **Government Funding** – Supported through disaster preparedness budgets
- **CSR Collaborations** – Corporate sponsorships for system enhancements
- **Public-Private Partnerships** – Long-term maintenance and technical support
- **Free Access** – Available to verified NGOs, relief agencies, and registered volunteers
